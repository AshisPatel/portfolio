  This is the repository for my personal portfolio that I created using React. Feel free to check it out using the link provided in the Website section of this readme. Now, more about the actual code! This application is a single page application (SPA), however it has the feel of a multi-page application thanks to React Router. On top of that, there is some utilization of bootstrap classes for general spatial orientation of the view and the rest is custom CSS. Thanks to the ability to inject JavaScript into our JSX, the entire portfolio uses a large amount of conditional rendering to change what is displayed on the webpage. There is also some dynamic size adjustments using the windows viewport (check out the nav buttons to burger button transition on smaller than medium screens). When viewing the projects tab, all projects are loaded by default (scroll down to reveal more projects!). Hover over any of the project cards to reveal more information about that specific project, as well as access a link to the project repository and website. However, you can show the tags and select a single tag, or combination of tags to see if there are any relevant projects. As a final note, the form in the contact tab will allow you to provide a phone number or email should you toggle on the 'contact me' option. Otherwise, this form only requires some sort of name and message. While there is form input validation required to submit the form, the data will be submitted to my personal email thanks to NodeMailer!

  **NOTE:** I am still adding projects and editing the tags for each project, so these may change in between your visits!

  <h2>End Note - A Thank You to the Reader</h2>

  Hello there friend! I hope that you're having a pleasant day, afternoon, evening, or strange midnight hours! Thanks for taking the time to visit my repo and check out my portfolio (if you haven't, go give it a whirl, at least scroll up and down the projects section for me). I have left a gift for you in the form of a fun fact and gif that makes me laugh at the end of this section! Hopefully they brighten your day, or at the least give you something to share with a friend. Now for a small rant. I learned a tad bit too late that there are LOOPS IN SCSS! The tools that people make are so *incredible*, maybe one day I'll make something neat too. On top of that, React is genius! I know we could technically interact with HTML via JavaScript files before, but being able to directly interject it into the HTML? Now that's something else. These past few weeks have just been continuous moments of awe for me. With this technology under my belt, I hope to have a few apps in the works here, so come back and visit my repo in the future and maybe you'll see something of use to you! Till next time friend, have a good one! (^^)b

  **Fun Fact**: Night Rainbows Are Real. They're Called "Moonbows". Give this one a Google images search, you might find a new wallpaper background!
